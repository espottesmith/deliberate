    "This notebook shows some basic examples of analysis that can be done to study the composition of the LIBE dataset. For instance, we look at the numbers of different species and different types of bonds that appear in the dataset, the different charges and spin multiplicities present, and the sizes of molecules as measured by the number of electrons.\n",
