    "## Purpose of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can filter the LIBE dataset in a variety of ways. While we have already filtered LIBE, it might be desirable to further limit the dataset for some application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of filters are currently defined in `src/deliberate/filters.py`:\n",
    "- `filter_by_charge_and_isomorphism`: Remove molecules that are isomorphic and have the same charge (taking, for instance, either the singlet or the triplet state, depending on which one has a lower electronic energy)\n",
    "- `filter_species`: Remove molecules including certain species\n",
    "- `filter_bond_species`: Remove molecules with certain types of bonds\n",
    "- `filter_bond_length`: Remove molecules with bond lengths much longer than is typical\n",
    "- `filter_num_bonds`: Remove molecules where any atoms have an inappropriate number of bonds (for instance, carbon having more than 4 bonds)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that with the `filter_dataset` function, multiple filters can be applied in sequence. Additional filter functions could be added, provided that they return a `List[Dict]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you get\n",
    "\n",
    "`final`, a somewhat reduced LIBE dataset."
